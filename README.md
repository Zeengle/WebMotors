Hi, this is my first full data based project based on buying and selling "cars" in this website, that runs in a simple server with local ip adress, before start running please install node.js and your modules, like colors, ejs, mongodb@4.1, express and body-parser

and least but not last dont forget to put your MondoDB uri in the "servidor.js" and rename your collections acording to the code. Thanks!
